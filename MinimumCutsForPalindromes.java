/*
Given a string, a partitioning of the string is a palindrome partitioning if 
every substring of the partition is a palindrome. Determine the fewest cuts 
needed for a palindrome partitioning of a given string.
Assumptions
The given string is not null
Examples

“a | babbbab | bab | aba” is a palindrome partitioning of “ababbbabbababa”.

The minimum number of cuts needed is 3.
