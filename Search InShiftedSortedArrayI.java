/*
Data Structure
Search In Shifted Sorted Array I
Given a target integer T and an integer array A, A is sorted in ascending order first, then shifted by an arbitrary number of positions.

For Example, A = {3, 4, 5, 1, 2} (shifted left by 2 positions). Find the index i such that A[i] == T or return -1 if there is no such index.

Assumptions

There are no duplicate elements in the array.
Examples

A = {3, 4, 5, 1, 2}, T = 4, return 1
A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, T = 4, return 3
A = {3, 5, 6, 1, 2}, T = 4, return -1
Corner Cases

What if A is null or A is of zero length? We should return -1 in this case.
